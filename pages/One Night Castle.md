- This is a team-based multiplayer mode where groups of three players join forces. You will enter battle events with pre-arranged team formations. The goal is to finish building Sunomata Castle within a single day, gathering construction materials and processing intermediates by day, and assembling the castle at night.
- The game lasts 20 minutes, split equally between day and night phases. When time's up, points are awarded based on the final tier reached in building Sunomata Castle.
- ### Background
- The historical context is Kinoshita Tōkichirō (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) leading his forces upstream of the Kiso River to prepare lumber for a new fortress. They prefabricated parts of the fortress, then floated them downstream on rafts. Upon reaching Sunomata, Tōkichirō and his 2,000 strong construction crew swiftly assembled these pre-made elements, erecting the Sunomata Castle overnight on the frontier between Owari and Mino provinces—hence the legendary "Sunomata One Night Castle."
