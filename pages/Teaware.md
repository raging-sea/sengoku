- ### Introduction
- Teaware in Sengoku Fubu offers strategic advantages to players by boosting their Hero's abilities. The process of acquiring and upgrading teaware involves several steps and resources.
- ### Getting Teaware
- To craft teaware, players must first acquire [[Pottery Clay]]. This essential resource is available through various means, including:
	- Purchasing from Shop.
	- Completing quests.
	- Other in-game activities and sources.
- The availability of [[Pottery Clay]] allows players to craft Teaware, which can then be equipped to their Heroes for added benefits.
- ### Upgrading Teaware
- Enhancing the attributes of teaware is a critical aspect of gameplay. This process requires another resource known as [[Glaze]], which can be obtained by:
	- Disenchanting unnecessary or excess Teaware.
	- Purchasing from Shop.
	- Other in-game activities and sources.
- The upgrade levels available for teaware are dependent on the player's [[Title]] within the game. As players progress and attain higher titles, they can access more advanced upgrade options for their teaware.
- ### Title Reduction and Its Impact
- A player's in-game [[Title]] influences the effectiveness of their Teaware. If a player's Title is reduced, for any reason, the attributes of the Teaware will be capped at the maximum limit of the new, lower rank. This mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the game, as players must consider the impact of their Title on their equipment.
