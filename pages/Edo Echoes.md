- Only *one type* of the mini-game will be triggered in the same Classic Match.

- The goal of the game is to *find the differences* in 2 Ukiyo-e Images. Each game lasts 2 minutes. The countdown starts as you enter the game and exits automatically when time's up.
- Each Ukiyo-e image has *15* set differences. You'll earn matching random resource rewards based on how many differences you spot. Resources like provision and coins are applied instantly, while other rewards are mailed. For instance, if you spot 5 differences, you'll randomly receive 5 rewards from the rewards pool.
