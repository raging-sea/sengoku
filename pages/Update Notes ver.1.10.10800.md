- ❇️ [[Pinnacle Hero]] Event Time: The deadline for enlisting the Pinnacle Hero, [[Imagawa Yoshimoto, Defying the World]], has been set to [[May 15th, 2024]] , at 2:59 PM GMT (was [[Jun 15th, 2024]] ).
- ❇️ [[Tenka Fubu]] [[Betting]]: 1. Correct betting now earn: 20 Koban per advancing player identified, capped at 200 Koban, plus 5 Merit Chests. 2. For each combat area, the limit on how many players you join the betting is now set to half of that area’s total advancing players, always rounding to the nearest lower whole number.
- ❇️ [[Hero Adjustment]]: SP [[Matsudaira Motoyasu, March On Kyoto]]'s awakening skill [Thrive] has been adjusted, boosting his Provoke chance from 60% to a formidable 80% and enhancing his defense with an increased The Wall chance from 70% to 80%. Additionally, this skill has been capped at 7 activations per turn, ensuring strategic depth in every encounter.
- ❇️ [[Darkfield]] & [[Darkfighter]]: [[Backup Hero]] is available in these games
- ❇️ [[Backup Hero]]: The cultivation of Backup Hero only boosts their abilities when they're assigned as Backup Hero. For instance, if Heroes A and B have a combined ability, and A brings B along as his backup, focusing on developing B's backup skills will strengthen their combo’s power.
- ❇️ [[Conquest Points]]: Players at title [[Daifu]] entering the [[Martial Conquest]] during the week can instantly earn the maximum allotment of conquest points available.
- ❇️ [[Scroll Decipherer]]: Added 2 new shops, Inspire Trade and Deals Galore
- ❇️ [[Battle]]
- 1. Cap on actions per turn increased to 120.
- 2. Refine action calculation methods. Specifically address instances where Ukiyo-e couldn't activate due to forced progression to the next turn, ensuring elements like [[Ukiyo-e]], [[Shadow Spark]], and Passive Abilities of [[Pinnacle Hero]] are individually calculated and reliably activated.
- 3. For [[Classic Match]] and [[Tenka Fubu]] battles, commence combat at double speed, shifting to quadruple speed at round seven.
- ❇️ Bug fixed: Resolve the glitch where [[Staff]] buffs failed to apply within Hero Formations.
