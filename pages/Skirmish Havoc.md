- Skirmish Havoc is one of the mini-games that can be encountered in the Classic Match, featuring a total of 2 levels.
- The mini-game will randomly start within 5 hours after the battle begins. If the battle ends too quickly, the mini-game may not have a chance to start. The goal of the game is to successfully reach the endpoint marked on the map or defeat all enemies.
- Our pieces are distinguished by a blue color, while enemy pieces are red. Tiles accessible to our pieces are marked with a yellow glow.
- When our chess piece lands on different tiles on the map, it triggers different events:
	- Troop Tile: When your forces land on a troop tile, you can upgrade them to the type specified by the tile, increasing their strength as indicated. If you encounter an enemy troop, battle ensues.
	- Castle Tile: Unknown
	- Boat Tile: Enables the boat to navigate along rivers.
	- Dock Tile: Provides a docking spot for boats.
	- Treasure Chest Tile: Collects rewards.
- Troops
	- Within the mini-game, players can encounter 4 different types of Troops: Infantry, Samurai, Cavalry, and Musketeer.
	- Troop types have counter relationships that impact troop strength expenditure in battle. When at a disadvantage, troops consume twice their usual strength.

- Rewards
	- Rewards are only granted for completing the mini-game; early failure means losing any chests collected along the way. Keep your troop strength above zero and don't take on unwinnable battles!
	- Rewards after winning the mini-game are tiered according to how fully you meet the level's objectives, with three distinct completion tiers offering varying rewards.
		- | Level Rewards | Normal | Good | Elite |
		  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
		  | Level Objective | Reach the endpoint | Obtain 3 treasure chests | Eliminate all enemies |
		  | Rewards | Provisions/Coins x30,000 | Provisions/Coins x50,000 | Provisions/Coins x100,000 |
	- Upon victory in the game, any treasure chests gathered will be unlocked, offering a chance to randomly receive character resources as rewards.
